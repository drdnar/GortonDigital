# GortonDigital
A revival of a 20th century interwar font.

In the early- to mid-20th century, the George Gorton Machine Company made
engraving machines (among other machines).  They also made a few typefaces that
were often used with the machines, the most common of which was simply called
Gorton.  This is a digitalization of the Gorton font family.

## Variants in the Family
The Gorton typeface was available in several fonts of varying sizes and widths,
and in an inclined variant.  Currently, I only have the normal width available.

## Digitization process

## Notes on Specific Glyphs

## Creating the Output Fonts from the Template
